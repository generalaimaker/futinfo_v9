## üìã Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. Create missing Board, Comment, and UserProfile models/DTOs
2. Implement repository methods for community features
3. Fix import errors in existing files
4. Create auth UI screens
5. Implement proper navigation flow

### Architecture Improvements
1. Add proper error handling and retry logic
2. Implement caching strategy
3. Add real-time updates for posts/comments
4. Create reusable UI components
5. Add proper loading and error states

### Feature Parity with iOS/Web
1. Implement all missing screens
2. Add image upload functionality
3. Create rich text editor
4. Add search and filtering
5. Implement user profiles and settings

## üö® Critical Issues

1. **Broken Imports**: PostDto and Post model have imports for non-existent files
2. **Navigation Parameter**: CommunityScreen expects navigation callback not provided
3. **Missing Core Features**: No way to create posts, view details, or interact beyond basic listing
4. **No Authentication UI**: Users cannot login or signup

The Android app's community features are currently in a very basic state with only post listing functionality. Significant work is needed to reach feature parity with iOS and Web platforms.
